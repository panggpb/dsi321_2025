**Author**: Intita Pitpongkul  
**Course**: DSI321 ‚Äì Big Data Infrastructure  
**Institution**: Data Science and Innovation, Thammasat University

## Project Overview
This project is part of the DSI321: BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE course. It presents a real-time air quality analytics system focused on PM2.5 levels in Thailand. The data pipeline is orchestrated using Prefect.io, with storage in LakeFS and Parquet format.

A classification model using Random Forest is applied to predict whether air quality is "Good" or "Bad". The results are visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, which includes time-series plots, maps, and classification outputs.

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a system that automatically collects, processes, and analyzes real-time air quality data‚Äîespecially PM2.5‚Äîfrom monitoring stations across Thailand. The goal is to make this information accessible, understandable, and actionable through a clean, interactive dashboard.

Data is retrieved from the Air4Thai API, provided by Thailand‚Äôs Pollution Control Department, allowing for hour-by-hour monitoring using reliable and up-to-date sources.

The pipeline is automated using Prefect 3, covering every step from data ingestion to cleaning, transformation, and storage. All data is saved in Parquet format and version-controlled using LakeFS, enabling reproducibility, traceability, and organized data management.

For analysis, a Random Forest Classifier is trained to classify air quality as either ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad,‚Äù based on temporal and geographic features. This classification helps identify areas and times with potentially hazardous air quality conditions.

Insights are delivered through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, which displays trends, predictions, maps, and other visualizations. The dashboard is designed to support decision-makers, local communities, and the general public in staying informed about current air quality conditions. 

## Objective  
- Data Collection: Gather real-time PM2.5 data from multiple stations across Thailand.
- Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Visualization: Create interactive charts and maps to display air quality trends.
- Machine Learning: Implement a classification model to predict air quality status.

# Dataset Preparation and Integration  
The system automatically retrieves near real-time PM2.5 air quality data from the Air4Thai API, maintained by Thailand‚Äôs Pollution Control Department. Once ingested, the dataset undergoes several processing steps to ensure usability and structure:

- Data Cleaning: Invalid readings (e.g., negative PM2.5 values) are removed or forward-filled based on station history.
- Time-based Partitioning: Data is organized into a hierarchical folder structure by year/month/day/hour for efficient querying.
- Parquet Storage on lakeFS: Cleaned records are saved in partitioned Parquet format within lakeFS, enabling version control and reproducibility.
- Schema Validation: A defined schema (schema.md) is used to validate data types and column names, minimizing inconsistencies and preserving pipeline stability over time.

This pipeline ensures that the data is always well-structured, traceable, and ready for downstream use in dashboards and modeling.
