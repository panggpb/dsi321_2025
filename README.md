# dsi321 Real-Time Data Pipeline
real-time weather data forecasting pipline with visualization

#Introduction
This project focuses on building a robust end-to-end system for real-time air quality data orchestration, forecasting, and visualization using technologies such as Prefect 3, Docker, and GitHub. It plays a critical role in supporting environmental surveillance, public health initiatives, and urban planning by delivering timely and actionable insights into air quality trends and potential risks, particularly in the Rangsit area of Pathum Thani, Thailand.

The system leverages the Air4Thai API, which provides hourly PM2.5 concentration data collected from automated air quality monitoring stations across Thailand. The API is maintained by Thailandâ€™s Pollution Control Department, ensuring authoritative and up-to-date environmental information.
